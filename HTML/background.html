    <p class = "para"><!--<img src="PhotosNeeded\small.jpg" alt= "Photo of a small town"/>-->I was born and raised in a small town.Usually these small towns are not the most developed however there are benefits as well disadvantages. Some of the benefits of living in a small town include the fact that there is natural scenery to enjoy. Mnay people enjoy spending their time in such sceneries cause it has numerous benefits. Such as relaxation of the mind and body. Another advantage was the sense of familarity one develops from living in a small town.
    However small towns often have their disadvatnages also. Such as the fact that employment is often scarce. Resources are also scarce.</p>
